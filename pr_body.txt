## Summary

This PR adds §19.10 — AI Auto-Approval & Auto-Merge Exception (Locked) to the Tippy Decision Ledger. This section replaces the existing §19.10 with a more comprehensive policy that includes both auto-approval and auto-merge capabilities for AI agents.

## Changes

- **Updated §19.10** in `docs/TIPPY_DECISION_LEDGER.md`:
  - Replaced existing "AI Auto-Approval Exception" with "AI Auto-Approval & Auto-Merge Exception"
  - Added comprehensive scope definitions (allowed PR scope, file path restrictions)
  - Added technical preconditions (build, tests, migrations, static checks, secrets/POPIA guardrails)
  - Added CI preconditions (GitHub/Doppler status checks, merge state)
  - Added auto-approval and auto-merge behaviour specifications
  - Added audit logging requirements
  - Added human override mechanisms

- **Updated Table of Contents** to reflect new section title

- **Created `docs/AI_AUTO_APPROVAL_AGENT_SPEC.md`**:
  - Operational checklist for AI agents implementing §19.10
  - Step-by-step verification procedures
  - Audit entry format specifications

## Policy Highlights

§19.10 defines the **only** circumstances under which an AI agent may:
1. **Approve** a Pull Request as a reviewer
2. **Merge** that Pull Request into `main`

without human review.

Key requirements:
- Scope limited to implementation-only changes (`src/**`, `tests/**`, `infra/db/migrations/**`)
- Explicit exclusions for governance files (Ledger, locked sections, Doppler configs)
- Local technical checks must pass (build, tests, migrations, lint, typecheck)
- CI preconditions must be satisfied (all required checks green, mergeable state)
- Audit logging required for all AI-approved/merged PRs
- Human override via `no-auto-merge` label

## Compliance

- ✅ Only Ledger file and new agent spec doc modified
- ✅ Existing §19.10 replaced (not duplicated)
- ✅ All other locked sections preserved
- ✅ TOC updated correctly
- ✅ No sensitive data introduced

## Important Note

**This PR must be approved by human Governance Lead; AI auto-approval does not apply until §19.10 is on main.**

The new §19.10 policy explicitly excludes modifications to `docs/TIPPY_DECISION_LEDGER.md` from auto-approval/merge, so this governance PR requires human review per the policy itself.
